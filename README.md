The Sensor Placement project was the final group project for ISYE 6333 - Operations Research for Supply Chains, taught by Dr. Mathieu Dahan at Georgia Tech in Fall 2021.
This course covered linear and integer programming for optimization, focusing on formulation intuition.

Acknowledgements: Professor Dahan and his TA Javier Vega Lira, for the problem statement. My teammates Aurimas Racas and Hayden Dessomes for their contributions to the project.
