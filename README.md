The Sensor Placement project was the final group project for ISYE 6333 - Operations Research for Supply Chains, taught by Dr. Mathieu Dahan at Georgia Tech in Fall 2021.
This course covered linear and integer programming for mathematical programming, focusing on formulation intuition.

Acknowledgements: Professor Dahan and his TA Javier Vega Lira, for the problem statement. My teammates Aurimas Racas and Hayden Dessomes for their contributions to the project.

Included in this repository are the following:

SensorPlacement_Reqs.pdf - Project Requirements. This project involved the creation of integer programs to create an optimal setup for sensor placement in a water distribution network.

Critcality.csv; Detection_Matrix.csv - Project Data (given).

SensorPlacement_NB.ipynb - Jupyter NB used to complete the analysis. Utlizes PuLP for mathematical programming, Gurobi as the IP solver, Pandas and Seaborn for visualization.

SensorPlacement_NB.html - HTML printout of the Jupyter NB.

SensorPlacement_PPT.pdf - Slide Deck for Presentation.
